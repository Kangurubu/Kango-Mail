# Kango-Mail
A desktop mail client project  

Currently the project doesn't offer much, it will be updated.


<h1> How to run?</h1>
- First, add the IMAP server you want to connect to the main.py file.  

Currently not using XOAUTH2, so, you can't connect to ones using XOAUTH2, like your gmail account.  
After that, run the commands below.
<br />

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
Finally, you also need to change some lines in the ttkbootstrap library files. 
Look at the libchange.txt document.
